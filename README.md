What is this? - This is a basic web app and a proof of concept for myself. More specifically, this is for practising an exciting new technology, which we will definitely not fear and face head on! - Google Firebase.

Google Firebase is a platform for web, Android and iOS applications, that encompasses several Google products related to hosting, database, authentication, analytics and more.

This project is for 'fun'. In the end, it should have these features:
* CRUD functionality related to the Firestore (noSQL database, similar to MongoDB)
* Hosting through Firebase Hosting
* Authentication; Users who are logged in have more features
* Storage; Users can upload files.
* Routing using NodeJS and Express.
